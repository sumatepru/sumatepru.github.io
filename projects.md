Project 1's description
in this project, I created the repository for submitting projects troughout the Spring semester. then I practiced to clone the Gihub repository to local directory, edit it, add, commit, and push it back to the original GitHub repository.
In question 3 that required us to use GitHut as a platform to coordinate group project, I learned that creating a seperate branch from the main one is useful for distributing workloads amoung group members to work simultaneously, then use push ans pull mechanism to verify the changes the members make before merge them into the main branch.
The final exercise asked us to create our own GitHub webpage, which is fun and useful as a channel to publish our works.
